#These are the steps I took to install ubuntu 18.04 last time
#===========================================================
#Before anything else

disable secure boot in BIOS
also in bios it may be necessary to disable hybrid graphics. I currently have hybrid graphics disabled too, but I think with nvidia-prime you can leave this on
and actually switch between the nvidia gpu and the integrated intel gpu(much better battery life)
#=============================================================
#after ubuntu partition is set up
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo reboot now

#==============================================================
#setup nvidia drivers
go to software&updates then additional-drivers and select the nvidia one.
wait for it to finish installing and reboot again

now would probably be a good time to install cuda if you will be using it
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html

you can verify it is working by going to settings->details and the nvidia GPU should be listed instead of the integrated one. 
also running nvidia-smi will show gpu usage (this will only work after it is set up)
nvidia-settings opens a display menu to customize settings

this was helpful when trying to install cuda stuff (it broke apt and this recovered it)
sudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-overwrite" install --fix-broken

also if you get to making the sample cuda stuff and you get an error that says something about missing nvscibuf.h there is actually a missing file or something in cuda 10.2 so on the nvidia forum they said they are researching, but for now to just use make -k (to keep going after the error and build the other stuff)
#==============================================================
#install chrome
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

#==============================================================
#some apt install stuff that is helpful to have
sudo apt install htop vim vim-gtk curl git ssh

#==============================================================
#set up ssh key so you can use gitlab and github with ssh 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"
creates an public ssh key at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
add the ssh keys at gitlab/github click on profile then settings then ssh-keys then add ssh key and copy it into there

#=============================================================
#installing ROS
now is a good time to install ROS because it comes with a lot of other dependencies that we will use

best to do it with the update_dependencies script because that handles ros and all of the other dependencies that we need here. it is in https://gitlab.com/fortem/anansi_dev_tools

#==============================================================
#Gnome extensions 
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks chrome-gnome-shell gnome-shell-extensions
add gnome extension to chrome https://extensions.gnome.org/
added topicons openweather 

sudo apt install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 gir1.2-nm-1.0 gir1.2-clutter-1.0 
sudo apt install gnome-system-monitor
then you can add gnomestatspro and system-monitor

#======================================
#Some file installation from this repo https://github.com/jacobmoroni/ubuntu_hacks

sudo apt install zsh terminator guake
install vim with setupvim.sh
set up ohmyzsh with zsh by following instructions in readme
set up terminator with instructions on readme 
copy guake.desktop into autostart with  cp /usr/share/applications/guake.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
guake has an issue in ubunty 18.04 apt repo that causes it to crash when trying to exit. this is the fix
It's a Python indenting issue.
https://github.com/Guake/guake/commit/f8699b4be6c058fd58a33a1d783cd404e9076b0e

In current 18.04 package (guake 3.0.5-1), it's this file (line 1420):
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/guake/guake_app.py

it wont be fixed in the apt repos
#=================================================================
#clone necessary repos
they can be found here
https://fortemtech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FT1/pages/737738784/DroneHunter+Repositories
Dont forget to follow the readmes in the repos to set up correctly

#======================================================================
#Installing slack
this adds slacke to the apt repos and adds it to start on boot
wget https://downloads.slack-edge.com/linux_releases/slack-desktop-4.0.2-amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./slack-desktop-*.deb
cp /usr/share/applications/slack.desktop ~/.config/autostart           

#======================================================================
#installing jetbrains programs
this guy set up a ppa to get the latest so they just install and update with apt
https://github.com/JonasGroeger/jetbrains-ppa
To use, call this to add the repos

curl -s https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/jetbrains-ppa/0xA6E8698A.pub.asc | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb http://jetbrains-ppa.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jetbrains-ppa.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

then install them

sudo apt install clion intellij-idea-ultimate pycharm-community
then for intellij and pycharm when you set them up add the link to run from command line
