#These are the steps I took to install ubuntu 18.04 last time
#===========================================================
#Before anything else

disable secure boot in BIOS
also in bios it may be necessary to disable hybrid graphics. I currently have hybrid graphics disabled too, but I think with nvidia-prime you can leave this on
and actually switch between the nvidia gpu and the integrated intel gpu(much better battery life)
#=============================================================
#after ubuntu partition is set up
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo reboot now

#==============================================================
#setup nvidia drivers
go to software&updates then additional-drivers and select the nvidia one.
wait for it to finish installing and reboot again

now would probably be a good time to install cuda if you will be using it
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html

you can verify it is working by going to settings->details and the nvidia GPU should be listed instead of the integrated one. 
also running nvidia-smi will show gpu usage (this will only work after it is set up)
nvidia-settings opens a display menu to customize settings

this was helpful when trying to install cuda stuff (it broke apt and this recovered it)
sudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-overwrite" install --fix-broken

also if you get to making the sample cuda stuff and you get an error that says something about missing nvscibuf.h there is actually a missing file or something in cuda 10.2 so on the nvidia forum they said they are researching, but for now to just use make -k (to keep going after the error and build the other stuff)
#==============================================================
#install chrome
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

#==============================================================
#some apt install stuff that is helpful to have
sudo apt install htop vim vim-gtk curl git ssh

#==============================================================
#set up ssh key so you can use gitlab and github with ssh 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"
creates an public ssh key at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
add the ssh keys at gitlab/github click on profile then settings then ssh-keys then add ssh key and copy it into there

#=============================================================
#installing ROS
now is a good time to install ROS because it comes with a lot of other dependencies that we will use

best to do it with the update_dependencies script because that handles ros and all of the other dependencies that we need here. it is in https://gitlab.com/fortem/anansi_dev_tools

#==============================================================
#Gnome extensions 
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks chrome-gnome-shell gnome-shell-extensions
add gnome extension to chrome https://extensions.gnome.org/
added topicons openweather 

#======================================
Some file installation from this repo https://github.com/jacobmoroni/ubuntu_hacks

sudo apt install zsh terminator guake
install vim with setupvim.sh
set up ohmyzsh with zsh by following instructions in readme
set up terminator with instructions on readme
